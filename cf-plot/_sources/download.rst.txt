To install cf-plot
==================

Linux
-----
To install cf-plot on your own Linux PC or laptop download and install Anaconda Python 2.7 for Linux.  On the command line type:

::

   conda install -c ncas -c conda-forge cf-python cf-plot udunits2=2.2.20 matplotlib=2.0.2
   conda install -c nesii -c conda-forge mpich esmpy


The first line installs cf-python and cf-plot.  The second installs esmpy, together with the netcdf-fortran and mpich requirements, which cf-python uses for regriding data.



Other Operating Systems
-----------------------
We have a small development team and Linux is our main working environment.  If you have the Mac or Windows operating system installing a Linux Virtual Machine is simple and works well.  Installation instructions and a Mint Linux Virtual Machine are avaulable at http://gws-access.ceda.ac.uk/public/ncas_climate/ajh/data_analysis_tools/VM.  




Other install methods
---------------------
Using pip:

::

   pip install cf-python
   pip install cf-plot


Using GitHub:

::

   git clone git://github.com/ajheaps/cf-plot.git
   cd cf-plot
   python setup.py install


You will need to download and install `cf-python <https://cfpython.bitbucket.io>`_ to use cf-plot.  Other cf-plot dependencies are: Numpy, Matplotlib, NetCDF4 and Cartopy.

Download the `sample netCDF datasets <http://gws-access.ceda.ac.uk/public/ncas_climate/ajh/data_analysis_tools/cfplot_data.tar>`_

If you have system priviledges on your server and can store the directory with the sample files in /opt/graphics the all the examples will work out of the box.  If not then store the files elsewhere and modify the file path appropriately.
