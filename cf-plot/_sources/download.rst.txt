Is cf-plot already installed?
=============================

Jasmin@CEDA - cf-plot is available inside the Jasmin Analysis Platform - type python2.7 to start python.

Archer Jasmin RDF - jasmin.rdf.ac.uk - This has the Jasmin Analysis Platform installed - type python2.7 to start python.

|  Archer - type  
|  **module swap PrgEnv-cray PrgEnv-intel**
|  **module load anaconda cf**
|  and then python to use cf-plot.

To install cf-plot
==================

Linux
-----
To install cf-plot on your own Linux box download and install Anaconda Python 2.7 for Linux.  On the command line type:

::

   conda install -c ncas -c scitools cf-python cf-plot
   conda install -c conda-forge -c nesii netcdf-fortran=4.4.4 mpich esmpy


The first line installs cf-python, cf-plot.  The second installs esmpy, together with the netcdf-fortran and mpich requirements, which cf-python uses for regriding data.



Other OSs
---------
It is recommended that you use a virtual machine with Linux running in it as some things don't, and probably won't ever work on other OSs - Met Office PP file reading for instance.  Windows is not supported or expected to be supported. If you are a Windows guru and manage to get cf-python and cf-plot working please contact andy.heaps@ncas.ac.uk with the details and I will post the installation details here.


Basemap and Cartopy conflict
----------------------------
The map projection that cf-plot uses at present conflicts with the Cartopy software.  cf-plot will move to using Cartopy when it is a little more mature but in the meantime if you need both then install them with the following before installing cf-plot.

::

   conda install -c conda-forge basemap cartopy


Other install methods
---------------------
Using pip:

::

   pip install cf-python
   pip install cf-plot


Using GitHub:

::

   git clone git://github.com/ajheaps/cf-plot.git
   cd cf-plot
   python setup.py install


You will need to download and install `cf-python <https://cfpython.bitbucket.io>`_ to use cf-plot.  Other cf-plot dependencies are: Numpy, Matplotlib, Netcdf4 and Basemap.

Download the `sample netCDF datasets <http://www.met.reading.ac.uk/~swsheaps/cfplot_data>`_
