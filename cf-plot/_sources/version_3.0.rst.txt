4. Grid drawing options changed
===============================

The grid_lons and grid_lats options used in cfp.setvars have been removed.  The grid drawing options for

The polar stereographic grid now takes the line colour, line width and line style from grid_colour, grid_linestyle and grid_thickness 
that are set in cfp.setvars.
