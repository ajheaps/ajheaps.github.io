Training material
*****************

We run one day courses on cf-python / cf-plot using the following training material.


Jupyter Notebooks and data for training class
=============================================

The tarred jupyter notebooks and data is 580MB: `jupyter.tar <http://www.met.reading.ac.uk/~swsheaps/ncas_data_tools/jupyter.tar>`_

Once downloaded in a terminal window type

|    tar xf jupyter.tar
|    cd jupyter
|    jupyter notebook

You will have needed to have installed cf-python and cf-plot if they are not already installed.  See the `installation notes <http://ajheaps.github.io/cf-plot/download.html>`_  if you need to do this.

Jasmin don't allow Jupyter notebooks at present as they are viewed as a possible security problem potentially allowing write access into user directories.

In the course we run through the exercises and student material in the following order:


Morning session
---------------

|    introduction.ipynb
|    
|    cf-python/cf_python.ipynb - sections 1 and 2
|    cf-python/cf_python_exercise_1.ipynb
|    cf-python/cf_python_exercise_2.ipynb
|    
|    cf-python/cf_python.ipynb- sections 3 - 5
|    cf-python/cf_python_exercise_3.ipynb
|    cf-python/cf_python_exercise_4.ipynb
|    


Afternoon session
-----------------

|    cf-plot/contour_plots.ipynb
|    cf-plot/contour_exercise_1.ipynb
|    cf-plot/contour_exercise_2.ipynb
|    
|    regridding/cf-python_regridding.ipynb
|    regridding/regridding_exercise_1.ipynb
|    regridding/regridding_exercise_2.ipynb
|
|    cf-plot/vector_line_significance.ipynb
|
|    wrap_up.ipynb
|

Worked exercise solutions are available in the model_answers directory for each section.
