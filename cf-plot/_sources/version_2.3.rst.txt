UKCP grid plotting

0. Added support for the UKCP grid
==================================

Support has been added for the UKCP grid which is an instance of the tranveverse mercator projection.

cfp.mapset(proj='UKCP') will give a transverse mercator projection with the limts of lonmin = -11, 
lonmax = 3, latmin = 49 and latmax = 61.

Some examples of this and other pavailable projections have been added at http://ajheaps.github.io/cf-plot/projections.html

New cfp.setvars options affecting the grid plotting for the UKCP grid are:

| grid=True - draw grid
| grid_spacing=1 - grid spacing in degrees
| grid_lons=None - grid longitudes
| gid_lats=None - grid latitudes
| grid_colour='grey' - grid colour
| grid_linestyle='--' - grid line style
| grid_thickness=1.0 - grid thickness
