Advanced Use
************

Here are some hints and tips on advanced use of cf-plot.


Adding user defined lines and text to plots
-------------------------------------------

In cf-plot the plot is stored in a plot object with the name cfp.plotvars.plot.  The page containing the plots is named cfp.plotvars.plot_master.

To see all the methods for the plot object type

::

    cfp.gopen()
    dir(cfp.plotvars.plot)



In this example we make a blank map plot, change the longitude labels and add a box and some text.  To add text and lines outside of the plot use the same method as below with coordinates outside of the defined plot area.

::

    cfp.gopen()
    cfp.levs(-1000, -900, 100)
    cfp.con(f.subspace(time=15),lines=0, fill=0)
    cfp.plotvars.plot.set_xticks([0.0, 45.0])
    cfp.plotvars.plot.set_xticklabels(['label1', 'label2'])
    cfp.plotvars.plot.set_xlabel('X axis plot label')

    xpts=[-150, -150, -90, -90, -150]
    ypts=[-5, 5, 5, -5, -5]
    cfp.plotvars.plot.plot(xpts,ypts, linewidth=3.0, color='blue')
    cfp.plotvars.plot.text(-120, 8, 'Nino3 region', horizontalalignment='center')
    cfp.gclose()





Changing colours in a colour scale
----------------------------------

The simplest way to do this without writing any code is to modify the internal colour scale before plotting.  The colours most people work with are stored as red green blue intensities on a scale of 0 to 255, with 0 being no intesity and 255 full intensity.

White will be represented as 255 255 255 and black as 0 0 0

The internal colour scale is stored in cfp.plotvars.cs as hexadecimal code.  To convert from decimal to hexadecimal use hex i.e.
hex(255)[2:]
'ff'

The [2:] is to get rid of the preceding 0x in the hex output.



for example to make one of the colours in the viridis colour scale grey use:

::

    import cf, cfplot as cfp
    f=cf.read('/opt/graphics/cfplot_data/tas_A1.nc')
    cfp.cscale('viridis', ncols=17)
    cfp.plotvars.cs[14]='#a6a6a6'
    cfp.con(f.subspace(time=15))
