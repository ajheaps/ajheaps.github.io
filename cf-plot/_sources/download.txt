=============================

Jasmin@CEDA - cf-plot is available inside the Jasmin Analysis Platform - type python2.7 to start python.

Archer Jasmin RDF - jasmin.rdf.ac.uk - This has the Jasmin Analysis Platform installed - type python2.7 to start python.

|  Archer - type  
|  **module swap PrgEnv-cray PrgEnv-intel**
|  **module load anaconda cf**
|  and then python to use cf-plot.

To install cf-plot
==================

Linux
-----
Download and install Anaconda Python 2.7 for Linux.  On the command line type:

::

   conda install -c ncas -c scitools cf-python cf-plot
   conda install -c nesii esmpy 

The first line installs cf-python, cf-plot and the second installs esmpy which cf-python uses for regriding data.



Other OSs
---------
It is recommended that you use a virtual machine with Linux running in it as some things don't, and probably won't ever, work on other OSs - Met Office PP file reading for instance.  



MacOS
-----
It is recommended that a Linux virtual machine is used on Macs.  If you wish to use a slighly out of date version of cf-plot directly on a Mac then follow the instructions below.

Download and install Anaconda Python 2.7 for MacOS.  On the command line type:

::

   conda install -c ncas -c scitools cf-python cf-plot
   conda install -c scitools esmpy

The first line installs cf-python, cf-plot and the second installs esmpy which cf-python uses for regriding data.

To use esmpy you'll also need to do a conda install of gcc and gfortran.  An fiddly part is putting the fortran libraries where esmpy needs to find them.  At the Python command prompt type import ESMF and an error message will indicate which libraries it cannot find.

On Macs to get Matplotlib graphic windows to appear user cfp.setvars(viewer='matplotlib') before making any plots.

Windows
-------
Windows is not supported or expected to be supported. If you are a Windows guru and manage to get cf-python and cf-plot working please contact andy.heaps@ncas.ac.uk with the details and I will post the installation details here.


Other install methods
---------------------
Using pip:

::

   pip install cf-python
   pip install cf-plot


Using GitHub:

::

   git clone git://github.com/ajheaps/cf-plot.git
   cd cf-plot
   python setup.py install


You will need to download and install `cf-python <http://cfpython.bitbucket.org>`_ to use cf-plot.  Other cf-plot dependencies are: Numpy, Matplotlib, Netcdf4 and Basemap.

Download the `sample netCDF datasets <http://climate.ncas.ac.uk/~swsheaps/cfplot_sphinx/data>`_
