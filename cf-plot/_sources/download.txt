To install cf-plot
==================

Linux
-----
Download and install Anaconda Python 2.7 for Linux.  On the command line type:

::

   conda install -c ncas -c scitools cf-python cf-plot
   conda install -c nesii esmpy 

The first line installs cf-python, cf-plot and the second installs esmpy which cf-python uses for regriding data.

MacOS
-----
Download and install Anaconda Python 2.7 for MacOS.  On the command line type:

::

   conda install -c ncas -c scitools cf-python cf-plot
   conda install -c scitools esmpy

The first line installs cf-python, cf-plot and the second installs esmpy which cf-python uses for regriding data.

To use esmpy you'll also need to do a conda install of gcc and gfortran.  An fiddly part is putting the fortran libraries where esmpy needs to find them.  At the Python command prompt type import ESMF and an error message will indicate which libraries it cannot find.



Windows
-------
Windows is not supported. If you are a Windows guru and manage to get cf-python and cf-plot working please contact andy.heaps@ncas.ac.uk with the details and I will the installation details here.

Using pip:

::

   pip install cf-python
   pip install cf-plot


Using GitHub:

::

   git clone git://github.com/ajheaps/cf-plot.git
   cd cfplot
   python setup.py install


You will need to download and install `cf-python <http://cfpython.bitbucket.org>`_ to use cf-plot.  Other cf-plot dependencies are: Numpy, Matplotlib, Netcdf4 and Basemap.
