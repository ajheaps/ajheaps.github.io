Examples of data analysis and visualisation
===========================================


1) `Read in netCDF file, select a field, print attributes of this field, save data as a netCDF <file:///home/swsheaps/cf-docs/cfplot_sphinx/_build/html/scicomp2_example1.html>`_
2) `Add a missing CF attribute, change units <file:///home/swsheaps/cf-docs/cfplot_sphinx/_build/html/scicomp2_example2.html>`_
3) `Data slicing and meaning <file:///home/swsheaps/cf-docs/cfplot_sphinx/_build/html/scicomp2_example3.html>`_
4) `Make longitude-latitude and polar contour plots <file:///home/swsheaps/cf-docs/cfplot_sphinx/_build/html/scicomp2_example3.html>`_
5) `Zonal mean the data and plot <file:///home/swsheaps/cf-docs/cfplot_sphinx/_build/html/scicomp2_example4.html>`_
6) Take two data sets and interpolate them to the same grid.  Plot before and after
   Discuss area averages, and field conservation?
7) Monthly mean some daily data and plot
8) Ensemble average some data
9) A stats example

10) Combining data (i.e. collection of netcdf files into netcdf entity)
11) Split-apply-combine and reshaping
